*In this first blog post, I will try to figure out for myself ‚ÄúWhy I want to have this blog exists?‚Äù.*

I'm a software engineer with around or 8 years of experience in different areas like web development (full stack), systems engineering, and software architecture. 
In my career, I played different roles from software engineer to the development team leader and solution architect.

This blog will be focused on a technical area, especially on software engineering and systems architecture.

I hatched the idea of start writing for a long time, but as always ‚Äúno time‚Äù was my justification. 
So as in all best time management guidelines, I‚Äôm here to ‚Äúsplit‚Äù and ‚Äústart‚Äù ‚úä. 

This small blog post is the first small iteration in (I hope soü§û) a big journey.

In the end, I found the next items driving me to this decision....

**I'm obsessed with learning...** that‚Äôs my trait forcing me to always dig into details, explore new knowledge, and imagine insights. 
But we all make mistakes in our journey, often we need feedback from someone else to not stay blind. 
So I would like to use this blog as a platform where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and tries, to gather feedback that will help me 
(and I hope everyone else who may find this blog on the internet) to grow and overcome.

**I always share my knowledge...** I'm catching myself on this statement very often. One of the biggest parts of my professional life is building 
efficient teams. Mentoring, onboarding, SDLC setup, defining suitable processes that's all that I'm doing daily. 
But here is always some commonalities, some approaches, processes, and knowledge which with some adjustments can or can't be applied in different situations. 
So that I see this blog also as a place where I can keep tutorials which then I can use in my professional life by sharing with my colleagues, 
or by myself in a case when I need to revise anything and of course keep them open for the broader audience which I suspect will help me to maintain and 
evolve them).

**I love helping people...** I‚Äôm so delighted by OSS (‚Äúopen-source software‚Äù) model, but at some point in time, I've realized that I can do much better 
by not only using but also by contributing. I already had a try a few years ago, but "lack of time" as usual, end-up my enthusiasm. 
I hope that this blog will help me to bring some value to the community.

Hope this chapter will be long... Stay tuned!
