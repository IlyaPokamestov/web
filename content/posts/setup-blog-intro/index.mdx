This post will start a huge story of the creation and evolution of my blog.

I have a plan to include in this tutorial the description of everything that I'm going to do with this blog and what's the reasons behind it.

This tutorial will include the next sections:
- Blog Part 1: Overview of solutions for building websites.
- Blog Part 2: Setup a simple blog using GatsbyJS.
- Blog Part 3: Deploying static website to Netlify.
- Blog Part 4: Developing a Gatsby theme.
- **TBD**

*Note: I'll add links to corresponding articles as soon as they will be ready...*
